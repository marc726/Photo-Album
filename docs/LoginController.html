<p>The LoginController class is responsible for managing the user interface and functionality related to user login.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>handleLoginButtonAction(ActionEvent event)</h3>
<p>Handles the event when the "Login" button is clicked. Checks if the entered username exists. If it does not exist, displays an error message and returns. If it exists, loads the UserDashScene and initializes the UserController with the logged in user. If an error occurs during this process, prints the stack trace and returns.</p>

<h3>initialize()</h3>
<p>Initializes the LoginController. This method is automatically called after the FXML file has been loaded. It sets the text of the label to display the JavaFX and Java versions.</p>
