It handles user creation, user deletion, and data persistence.</p>

This method is automatically called by the FXMLLoader.</p>

<h3>handleCreateUserButtonAction(ActionEvent event)</h3>
<p>Handles the action when the "Create User" button is clicked.
Prompts the user to enter a username and creates a new user with the entered username.

<h3>handleDeleteUserButtonAction(ActionEvent event)</h3>
<p>Handles the action when the delete user button is clicked.

<h3>loadData()</h3>

If an error occurs during the loading process, an error message is printed along with the stack trace.</p>
